    <p><font face="Arial" size="4px" color="#00000"><center>Below is a basic strategy guide to get you through an Auction Draft for Fantasy Basketball</center></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="4px" color="#00000"><center>In order to get ahead, you'll need to figure out a couple of things beforehand...</center></font></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting Budget</li>
        <li>How Many Keepers?</li>
        <li>Punting Categories</li>
        <li>Your Guys</li>
    </ul>

<p>Once you've figured out these things. It's simple to get through the draft.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Whether it's $200 or $1000 to start, you'll always want to be aware of the budget so you can grab your first player for around a third of its total value.</li>
        <li>Take into account your keepers next and see how much of your budget is remaining to pick the last 8 guys are so.</li>
        <li>Verify which categories you are weak in and try to draft disregarding those values.</li>
        <li>Last but not least, make sure you are grabbing the players you are most high on! Give yourself more credit than you think!</li>
    </ol>
